# Bloodwire

Hello, this is the repository for Nocturnal Games upcoming game, Bloodwire.
It is a top down roguelike game where you collect blood from enemies to move
onto the next floor. While adventuring you will pick up items that boost your stats
and help you become stronger! You will also meet some mysterious NPCs during your 
journey as you try to help a small town from corruption. Will you get to the end?

The Google drive link to the prototype is currently hosted here:

We hope to talk to you again soon!
